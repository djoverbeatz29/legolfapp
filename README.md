# Welcome to Le Golf App!

## This here is a simple app whereby users can do the following:

- Create a profile
- Log in and out of said profile
- Book reservations at courses found within L'App
- Add and delete courses within the app, and update the information regarding said courses
- Leave reviews with ratings from 0-10 of said courses, along with optional commentary

Each course and users's average scores and ratings will be visible.

## Starting Out
A user can access the app by one of two ways:
1. Logging In
  - To log in, they must already have an existing account.
  - Login consists of an email and password; if there is an account with said email, with a matching password, access is granted.
2. Signing Up
  - To sign up, a user must enter their first & last name, email and password (as well as reentering password to confirm)
  - Upon successful entering of information, the user is signed into the app.

## Booking Tee Times
A user can book a tee time at any available course by entering the following information:
  - Date (month and day)
  - Time
  - Course
Afterwards, the user can edit or delete their tee time. They can also add whatever score they shot (e.g. 90).

## User Profile
Each user has their own profile page.
A user profile consists of all the reviews and scores submitted by users.
Based on average scores, the user's average score appears at the top of the screen, along with their calculated handicap.

## Course Info
Each course has its own page, displaying the following:
  - Course name
  - Picture of the course
  - Course bio
  - Average rating from 0-10 from users
  - Average score shot by users
  - All reviews left by users
Users can upload new courses played and can add a bio and profile picture for the course. Later, this course info can be edited by the original uploader.
